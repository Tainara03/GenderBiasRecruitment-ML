# Gender Bias in Recruitment - ML Analysis

This project analyzes gender bias in recruitment decisions using Machine Learning.

## Overview
- Dataset 1: Realistic recruitment decisions (detect bias)
- Dataset 2: Fairness simulation dataset (train unbiased model)

## Methodology
1. Data exploration and statistical analysis to detect bias
2. Train ML model on biased dataset (dataset 1)
3. Train ML model on fairness dataset (dataset 2)
4. Evaluate fairness metrics and compare results

## Libraries
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn
- optionally: fairlearn or aif360 for fairness metrics
